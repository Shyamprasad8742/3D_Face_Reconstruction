# 3D_Face_Reconstruction

This project describes the process of stereo-based 3D face reconstruction. The project comprised of 3 subjects, and the image of each subject captured from three different point of view. These three angles were indicated as left, middle, and right. The images were grouped as pairs, which were subsequently processed to construct two 3D surface meshes and later merged to render a 3D face.
